Description: RDFauthor is a javascript library used to create formular widgets out of RDFa-enhanced webpages
 RDFauthor is based on extracting RDF triples from RDFa annotations and transforming the
 RDFa-annotated HTML view into an editable form by using a set of
 authoring widgets. As a result, every RDFa-annotated web page can
 be made easily writeable, even if information originates from diï¬€erent sources.
 .
 RDFauthor is part of the LOD2 Technology Stack.
