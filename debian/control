Description: RDFauthor can be used to create formular widgets out of RDFa-enhanced webpages
 RDFauthor is based on extracting RDF triples from RDFa annotations and
 transforming the RDFa-annotated HTML view into an editable form by using
 a set of authoring widgets. As a result, every RDFa-annotated web page can
 be made easily writable, even if information originates from different
 sources.
 .
 RDFauthor is part of the LOD2 Technology Stack.
