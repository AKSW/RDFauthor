# RDFauthor advanced ideas #

## Events ##
- views etc. throw events
- RDFauthor registers for event (e.g. subject selected), thus is informed about current subject

## Widgets ##
- when registering, widgets can register properties that are queried for all properties (rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, rdfs:label etc.)
- RDFauthor fetches these automatically and provides widgets easy access to the results

## Property Selector ##
- shows a cloud or a dropdown box of possible properties for easier access
